You don't have to ask me to leave, you don't have to tell me when you leave, please let yourself out. I am not a babysitter, and this is very frustrating for me. You can use the TV, outlets, kitchen, refrigerator, etc etc. The only time communication is necesary is when you need to be let in because we are not allowed to make copies of keys so someone has to be home to let you in. I have been very accommodating of this- seeing that numerous guests have come in at 10:00 PM or later on multiple days. Other than that, you're an adult and can do what you want. If you have a question about where anything is, that is one thing or if you want to explore the city and need recommendations, that is fine. But I don't need to know your routine.","We aren't home much, but when we are we want to communicate with you!","- It is just the couch you will be sleeping on, but you will have access to the rest of the house i.e bathroom and kitchen. 3 of us live here and are very friendly!
